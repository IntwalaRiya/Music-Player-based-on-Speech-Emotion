# Music-Player-based-on-Speech-Emotion
Developed a music player that suggest you songs based on your current mood.
You just need to upload your audio file and it will suggest you songs.
For Machine Learning model, I have used MLP Classifier.
Apart from this, I have used Librosa library for extracting features from uploaded Audio file.
Current my system works only on 3 Emotions: Happy, Sad, Surprise. And has simple UI.
Dataset is used from site: https://www.kaggle.com/uwrfkaggler/ravdess-emotional-speech-audio
I achieved 89% accuracy using MLP Classifier model.
Upload your songs data in static folder in Music Player.
